    "prompt": "What is the Pythagorean Theorem?",
    "response": "The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry. It states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In symbols: c² = a² + b². You can use this to compute any side of a right triangle if you know the other two.",

    "prompt": "How do you solve a quadratic equation?",
    "response": "To solve ax² + bx + c = 0, apply the quadratic formula: x = (−b ± √(b² − 4ac))⁄(2a). First compute the discriminant D = b² − 4ac. If D > 0 there are two real roots, D = 0 gives one real root, and D < 0 gives two complex roots. Substitute a, b, c into the formula and simplify.",

    "response": "A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output value to each input value. Denoted f(x), it’s like a machine: you feed in x, and it returns f(x). For example, f(x)=2x+3 doubles x then adds 3. Functions let us model real-world relationships, like distance over time or cost based on quantity.",

    "response": "Permutations count arrangements **where order matters**, e.g. seating 3 people in 3 chairs: P(n,r) = n!/(n−r)!. Combinations count selections **where order doesn’t matter**, e.g. choosing 3 fruits from 5: C(n,r)=n!/(r!(n−r)!). Always ask: does the order change the outcome?",

    "response": "A derivative measures how a function’s output changes as its input changes—its instantaneous rate of change. If s(t) is position over time, then s′(t) gives velocity. Geometrically, the derivative at x is the slope of the tangent line to the curve y=f(x) at that point.",
